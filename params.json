{"name":"Latest Stable . io","tagline":"Makes it easy to be on \"latest stable\" with all your gem dependencies.","body":"### Workflow\r\n\r\nLatestStable.io makes it dead simple to stay up to date with the upstream changes of your gem dependencies.\r\n\r\n#### 1. Connect with GitHub\r\n\r\nAfter connecting your GitHub account we will watch your gem dependencies for upstream changes like security patches, new features and small bug fixes. However the best part is for public projects you can even skip the step of giving us access to your GitHub account as we only need the GitHub url of the project.\r\n\r\n#### 2. LatestStable will autoupdate your gem dependencies\r\n\r\nWhenever our systems see updates in the gems your project depends on we go through the following steps.\r\n\r\n1. Fork your project\r\n2. Update the gems to the latest stable version\r\n3. Push those changes back to GitHub\r\n4. Create a pull request for the updated code\r\n\r\nAt this point your continuous integration system picks up the new pull request and runs your test suite.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Merge the pull request once tests are passing\r\n\r\nAll you have to do is hit the merge button for the pull request we created. Done! Your now on latest stable!\r\n\r\nIn case your tests are we split up the updates until we know which gems failing the test. Think of this process as an `bundle update bisect` that will tell you which dependency updates you can merge without problems and which of the gems needs some modification before tests pass cleanly.\r\n\r\n### Get beta access\r\nWe are not quite ready with all the goody goodness we want to bring to you so there is no general signup just yet.
